# Hi, I'm Zakka 👋

Cloud Engineer from Indonesia, working with **AWS, Kubernetes, Terraform, and DevOps practices**.  
I care about building systems that are simple, reliable, and make sense in the real world.

Currently exploring advanced cloud architecture, DevOps culture, and how to bridge technology with real business impact.  

Outside of tech, I enjoy writing, photography, and videography.
