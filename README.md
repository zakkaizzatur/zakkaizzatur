# Hi, I'm Zakka 👋

Cloud Engineer from Indonesia, working with **AWS, Kubernetes, Terraform, and DevOps practices**.  
I care about building systems that are simple, reliable, and make sense in the real world.  

I hold certifications in **AWS Solutions Architect, Terraform, and Kubernetes (CKA, CKAD, CKS)**.  
Currently exploring advanced cloud architecture, DevOps culture, and how to bridge technology with real business impact.  

Outside of tech, I enjoy writing, photography, and videography.
