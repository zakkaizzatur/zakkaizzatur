# Hey, I'm Zakka 👋

I’m a Cloud Engineer based in Indonesia, currently focusing on **Kubernetes, Cloud Engineering, and Infrastructure as Code**.  
I enjoy designing systems that are simple, reliable, and make people’s lives easier without all the unnecessary buzzwords.

Outside of work, I’m a bit of a storyteller. I love writing, photography, and videography.
